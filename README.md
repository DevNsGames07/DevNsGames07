My name is Nick and I am 16 years old and I enjoy coding and learning different languages. 

Among other things, I spend a lot of time learning JavaScript, and I also use it to create my Discord bots. Python I have also made a Discord bot with it and a password generator. 

I have to take HTML for my school exam. Besides coding for myself, I am also working on a Fivem server with a team around it to turn it into a nice server. In addition, languange lua and database knowledge, mysql and more things that have to do with a database are also involved!

 I will continue to do coding for fun because I want to enjoy it and later make it my profession. And here on this GitHub I will upload fun projects and people can download them if necessary.

Skills: JS / PYTHON / LUA / HTML
